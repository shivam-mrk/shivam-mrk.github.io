					<li>  In today's session, I learned about the component events and application events in detail.</li>
					<li>I learnt how to create the event and how to register that event on the child component.</li>
					<li> In component events, registered events are handled by the <u>aura: handler</u> in another component called the parent component. And in the parent component, you have to call the child component explicitly. </li>
					<li> To preview the component event, you have to create the lightning app and in that you have to call only the parent component, as it has been in relationship with the child component.</li>
					<li> I also learnt about the Application event and it differ from component event. In application event there is no need call the child component explicitly.</li>
					<li> To preview the application event, you have to create the lightning app and in that you have to call child and parent component as they don't have any relationship between them</li>

							<b>Lightning: recordViewform :- </b> It used to display the record and record is in read only format.It uses the lightning:outputfield to show the records<br/>
							<b>Lightning:recordEditform :- </b> It is used to create and edit the record.with this form we are able to edit the record. It uses lightning:inputField to create and edit the record.<br/>
							<b>force:recordData :-</b>It  is used to create, data, edit or delete the record data.</li>
